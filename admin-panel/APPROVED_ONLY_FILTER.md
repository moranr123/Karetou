# ✅ Approved Businesses Only - Filter Implementation

## What Changed

The admin dashboard analytics now **only counts and displays approved businesses**, excluding pending and rejected businesses from the metrics.

## Affected Sections

### 1. **Total Registered Business Accounts**
- **Before:** Counted ALL businesses (pending, approved, rejected)
- **After:** Counts ONLY approved businesses ✅

### 2. **Active Accounts**
- **Before:** Counted all active businesses regardless of status
- **After:** Counts ONLY approved AND active businesses ✅

### 3. **Inactive/Closed Accounts**
- **Before:** Counted all inactive businesses regardless of status
- **After:** Counts ONLY approved AND inactive businesses ✅

### 4. **Top-Performing Businesses**
- **Before:** Included all businesses in rankings
- **After:** Shows ONLY approved businesses in top 5 ✅

### 5. **Pending Approvals** (Unchanged)
- Still counts pending businesses correctly ✅

## Implementation Details

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
  const data = doc.data();
  const status = data.status || 'pending';
  
  // Count pending businesses separately
  if (status === 'pending') {
    pendingCount++;
  }
  
  // Only process approved businesses for other metrics
  if (status === 'approved') {
    approvedCount++;
    
    if (isActive) {
      activeCount++;
    } else {
      inactiveCount++;
    }
    
    // Add to top performers list
    businessData.push({...});
  }
});
```

### What Gets Excluded:
- ❌ Businesses with `status: 'pending'`
- ❌ Businesses with `status: 'rejected'`
- ❌ Businesses without a status (defaults to pending)

### What Gets Included:
- ✅ Only businesses with `status: 'approved'`

## Before vs After

### Example Scenario:
You have:
- 50 approved businesses (30 active, 20 inactive)
- 12 pending businesses
- 5 rejected businesses

### Before (Wrong):
```
Total Registered Business Accounts: 67 (all businesses)
Active Accounts: 30+
Inactive Accounts: 37+
Pending Approvals: 12
Top Performers: Mix of approved/pending/rejected
```

### After (Correct):
```
Total Registered Business Accounts: 50 (approved only)
Active Accounts: 30 (approved & active)
Inactive Accounts: 20 (approved & inactive)
Pending Approvals: 12 (unchanged)
Top Performers: Only approved businesses
```

## Dashboard Cards Now Show:

### Overview Section:
| Card | Count |
|------|-------|
| Total Registered Business Accounts | Approved only |
| Active Accounts | Approved + Active |
| Pending Approvals | Pending (unchanged) |
| Inactive/Closed Accounts | Approved + Inactive |

### Top-Performing Businesses:
- Rank #1-5: Only approved businesses
- Sorted by viewCount
- Excludes pending/rejected businesses

## Why This Matters

### Business Logic:
1. **Pending businesses** are not yet verified → Shouldn't count as "registered"
2. **Rejected businesses** are not operational → Shouldn't count in active metrics
3. **Top performers** should only show verified, legitimate businesses
4. **Analytics** should reflect the actual operational business ecosystem

### User Experience:
- Admins see accurate count of **verified businesses**
- Pending businesses are clearly separated
- Top performers list shows only **legitimate businesses**
- Metrics reflect **real, operational businesses**

## Testing

1. Register a new business (status: pending)
2. Check dashboard
3. **Expected:**
   - Pending Approvals: +1 ✅
   - Total Businesses: No change ✅
   - Active Accounts: No change ✅
   - Top Performers: Not included ✅

### Test Case 2: Approve Business

2. Check dashboard

   - Total Businesses: No change ✅
   - Not counted anywhere else ✅

## Code Changes Summary

### Two Main Functions Updated:

#### 1. Real-time Listener (useEffect):
```typescript
// Only count approved businesses
if (status === 'approved') {
  approvedCount++;
  // ... count active/inactive
  // ... add to top performers
}
```

#### 2. Manual Refresh (fetchDashboardData):
```typescript
// Only count approved businesses
if (status === 'approved') {
  approvedCount++;
  // ... count active/inactive
  // ... add to top performers
}
```

## Benefits

## Status Values

### Possible Business Statuses:

### Default Behavior:
```typescript
